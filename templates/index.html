                <h1>Food Ontology Viewer</h1>
                <p>
                    On this website you can view most of the content of my food ontology. This ontology
                    consists of meals, which contain food(s) and drink(s) that contain ingredient(s) and are
                    respectively in state solid and liquid (purely used to distinct them, unimportant besides that).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This content can be viewed in 2 different views, the normal view and the hierarchic view.
                    In the normal view all the top content (meals, foods and drinks) with their contains relation(s) is queried from the
                    database and shown in a table. In the hierarchic view only the top content (meals) is queried
                    from the database, and shown with a button that does another query a level down (to foods/drinks)
                    which goes on until the lowest level (ingredients).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both views can be viewed with or without inferencing. With inferencing more results are shown,
                    as more entities are inferenced to be meals/drinks/foods and meals also contain the
                    ingredients of their foods/drinks now because of the transitive nature of the contains property.
                </p>
